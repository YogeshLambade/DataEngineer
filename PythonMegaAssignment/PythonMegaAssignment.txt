Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
ans:-Python is a general-purpose language, which means it's designed to be used in a range of applications, including data science, software and web development, automation, and generally getting stuff done and it is high-level language because it is not subject to the processor and easy to read.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
ans:-Python is dynamically  typed language because the type of the variable is determined only during runtime.

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
ans:-Varible are containers for storing data values.Just name the variable ,Assign the required value to it
      To declare an integer variable âˆ’ Name the variable ,Assign an integer value to it x=3
      Declare a string variable:-Assign a string value to the variable and it will become a string variable. In Python, the string value cane be assigned in single quotes or double quotes.
      ex.--y='hi'
      Declare a float variable - A float variable can be declared by assigning float value. Another way is by typecasting. We will use both. e.g--> x=2.0,x=float(2)
Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?

     print("Lastname is ",b)
     ex2-->
     x,y=input("Enter two Number").split(",")
     print(x)
     print(y)

Q10. What are keywords?
ans:-Keywords are some predefined and reserved words in python that have special meanings. 

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
ans:-Yes we can but we shoudn't as it will override the properties of the keyword.

True and False and True ---> False

1 or 0 or 0 ----> 1

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
ans:-A conditional statement as the name suggests itself, is used to handle conditions in your program. These statements guide the program while making decisions based on the conditions          encountered by the program.
     Python has 3 key Conditional Statements that you should know:
     if statement
     if-else statement
     if-elif-else ladder

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
ans:-The if/elif/else structure is a common way to control the flow of a program, allowing you to execute specific blocks of code depending on the value of some data.if 'if' condition fail
     it will check for 'elif' it also fails it executes else condition.

ls=list(tu)
ls.append("Name")
tu=tuple(ls)
print(tu)

x=tuple(x)
print(len(x))
Q45. What are sets in Python?
ans:A Python set is the collection of the unordered items. Each element in the set must be unique, immutable, and the sets remove the duplicate elements. Sets are mutable which means we can modify it after its creation

Q46. How can you create a set?
ans:we can create a set by using curly brackets but need a element in it.

Q47. Create a set and add "iNeuron" in your set.

Q50. What is clear() in sets?
ans:clear is used to remove all elements in set.

Q51. What is frozen set?
ans:Frozen set is just an immutable version of a Python set object. While elements of a set can be modified at any time, elements of the frozen set remain the same after creation

Q52. How is frozen set different from set?
ans:-Frozen set is just an immutable version of a Python set object. While elements of a set can be modified at any time, elements of the frozen set remain the same after creation. Due to this, frozen sets can be used as keys in Dictionary or as elements of another set.
Q53. What is union() in sets? Explain via code.
